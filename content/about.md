I’m Alfredo Gutierrez, a product designer. Currently designing operational software for the surrogacy industry at [Orchid Software Solutions](https://www.orchidsoftsolutions.com/).

Over the past 7 years, I've helped scale startups and companies by developing custom, reliable software that streamlines business processes across healthcare, surrogacy, legal services, and government contracting industries.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about surfing, music, learning languages, photography, traveling, and poetry.

I share my thoughts and tutorials on design, projects, and personal life on my [blog](https://alfredo.design/blog/). You can also see what I’m currently working on in my [professional changelog](https://alfredo.design/logs/).
