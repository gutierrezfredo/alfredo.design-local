UX/UI design of a web app that helps contractors find and manage government business opportunities.

I was hired by FBO Biz to design a cloud-base solution that would bring a better way of managing and winning government contracts. 

The biggest challenge was that the public solicitations published by the government had lack of organization. That’s why my aim was to design a product where the user could easily find and bid on solicitations, and at the same time maintaining an organized workflow during the bidding process.

As a result, I designed a web application that empowered the user to effortlessly find opportunities that fit their business capabilities, also bringing the clarity to follow up and keep track of any updates during the process. All this in a software that could be easily integrated with the company’s way of doing business.
